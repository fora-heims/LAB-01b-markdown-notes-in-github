# Alchemy DEV-101: Day 1
## Getting Comfortable in the Terminal
#
### Important Takeaways
* keep checking what directory you are currently in.
* github repositories will be used **_A LOT_** 
* we will be pushing and pulling files from multiple repositories, so getting comfortable navigating files with the Terminal, and using git commands, will be good to be comfortable with. _Practice, practice, practice._
* Markdown is fun and so useful for communicating with yourself and others about the contents and history of a repository.


| command |   function   |  options  |
|---------|------------|----------:|
|  `pwd`  |print working directory|  |
|  `ls`   |    list   |   `<file-name>` |
|   `cd`  | change directory |  `<directory-to-change-to>` |
|   `~`   |  home directory | often (C:/Users/username) |
|   `.`   |    current directory   |  self reference |
|  `..`   | go up/back a directory |  move one directory closer to the root directory |

### git commands
* `git add -A`  - _add **A**ll_
* `git commit -m "message"`  - _commit with **M**essage_
* `git push`  - _push committed files to the github repository_
* `git status`  - _shows the status of the currently open directory_
* `git remote -v`  - _View git repository origin_




## Markdown 
#
### Samples of Code
* Here is an example of  using 3 back quotes ``` before and after (adding the type of code at the beginning can help with formatting).
```html
<body>
</body>
```


* One other way to represent `code samples` using single back quotes (`) to surround code.

### **BOLD**
* **bold text can be written with 2 asteriscs  before and 2 asteriscs after the text to be bold.**

### _ITALICS_
* _italicized text can be written with 1 underscore before and 1 underscore after the text to be italicized._

### TABLES
It has been suggested to use this link for adding tables in markdown: [Link for Tables](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

* But in case you wanted to see a quick example, the syntax looks something like this:
```
|  Titles  |    Go    |  Here |
|----------|:--------:|------:|
|  name 1  |   Info   |  Data |
|  name 2  |   Info   |  Data |
|  name 3  |   Info   |  Data |
```

| Assignment |   Status   |  Comfortable with Material? |
